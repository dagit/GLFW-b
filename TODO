Is there a better way to accomplish the translation done by the 'C' class that
doesn't require TH?

Coordinate with GLFW C-library maintainer about any strange behavior.
1.) Cursor is in window. Left click.
    Events seen:
      cursor enter: CursorState'NotInWindow
      cursor enter: CursorState'InWindow
      mouse button: MouseButton'1 MouseButtonState'Pressed [mod keys: none]
      mouse button: MouseButton'1 MouseButtonState'Released [mod keys: none]
    The CursorState events seem spurious -- the cursor did not leave the
    window.

Coordinate with GLFW C-library maintainer about new functionality.
1.) waitEvents with timeout?
